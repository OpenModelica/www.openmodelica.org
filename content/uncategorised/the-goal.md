The main goals of the project is to:

<!--      
<ul class="arrow">
-->

  * <span lang="EN-US">Development and long-term support of an open source industrial-strength Modelica modeling and simulation environment for industrial and academic usage. </span>

  * <span lang="EN-US">Creation of a complete reference implementation of Modelica in an extended version of Modelica itself. Promoting a model-centric approach to give the modeler increased control, including modeling of both hardware- and software components in complex systems. </span>

  * <span lang="EN-US">Improved implementation techniques, e.g. to enhance the performance of compiled Modelica code by generating code for parallel hardware. </span>

  * <span lang="EN-US">Research in areas such as language design, control system design, debugging support, embedded system modeling, new symbolic and numerical algorithms, etc.</span>

We invite researchers and students, or any interested developer to participate in the project.

  * Participate in the [OpenModelicaInterest][328] discussion forum.

  * Help us: get the latest [source code][339] or [nightly-build][339] and [report bugs!][340]

  * To learn about Modelica, read a [book][341] or a [tutorial][342] about Modelica
