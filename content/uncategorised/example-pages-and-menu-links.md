title: "Example Pages and Menu Links"
---
<p>This page is an example of content that is <em>Uncategorized</em>; that is, it does not belong to any Section or Category. You will see there is a new Menu in the left column. It shows links to the same content presented in 4 different page layouts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Blog</li>
<li>Section Table</li>
<li>Blog Category</li>
<li>Category Table</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the links in the <strong>Example Pages</strong> Menu to see some of the options available to you to present all the different types of content included within the default installation of Joomla!.</p>
<p>This includes Components and individual Articles. These links or Menu Item Types (to give them their proper name) are all controlled from within the <strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Menu Manager-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Items Manager</span></strong>.</p>
