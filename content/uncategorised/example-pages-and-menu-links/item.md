title: "Example Pages and Menu Links"
---
This page is an example of content that is _Uncategorized_; that is, it does not belong to any Section or Category. You will see there is a new Menu in the left column. It shows links to the same content presented in 4 different page layouts.

  * Section Blog
  * Section Table
  * Blog Category
  * Category Table

Follow the links in the **Example Pages** Menu to see some of the options available to you to present all the different types of content included within the default installation of Joomla!.

This includes Components and individual Articles. These links or Menu Item Types (to give them their proper name) are all controlled from within the **<span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">Menu Manager->[menuname]->Menu Items Manager</span>**.
