OPENMODELICA is an open-source Modelica-based[^1] modeling and simulation environment intended for industrial and academic usage.
Its long-term development is supported by a non-profit organization – the [Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC)](/home/consortium).
An overview journal [paper](/research/the-openmodelica-integrated-environment-for-modeling-simulation-and-model-based-development) is available and [slides](images/M_images/Modelica-OpenModelica-slides.pdf) about Modelica and OpenModelica.

The goal with the OpenModelica effort is to create a comprehensive Open Source Modelica modeling, compilation and simulation environment based on free software distributed in binary and source code form for research, teaching, and industrial usage.
We invite researchers and students, or any interested developer to participate in the project and cooperate around OpenModelica, tools, and applications.

To get advice how to make existing Modelica libraries work in OpenModelica, see [Porting.](doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/porting.html)

For systems engineering with requirement traceability and verification, see [ModelicaML](/free-and-open-source-software/modelicaml/).

OpenModelica provides [library coverage reports](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/wiki/Library-Coverage-Testing) of open-source Modelica libraries showing which libraries work well with OpenModelica and how the support improved over time.
