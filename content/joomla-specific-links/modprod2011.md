<p><br /><strong>Supporting organizations</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Model-based Product Development (MODPROD) is an inter-disciplinary research center at Linköping University. It revolves around model-based tools and methods for mechanical systems, electronic systems and software, and unified approaches for model-based design. This workshop brings together expertise in these fields to discuss state of the art and the way ahead.</p>
<p>The Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC) is a non-profit organization supporting the<br />development of the OpenModelica Open-Source implementation of Modelica and <br />related tools, e.g. ModelicaML (UML-Modelica integration), for industrial and academic usage.</p>
