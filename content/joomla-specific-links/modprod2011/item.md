**Scope**

The workshops are concerned with, but not limited to, the following themes:

**MODPROD workshop:**

Integrated hardware-software modeling  
Hardware modeling  
Software modeling   
Multi-body systems  
Multi-domain/Multi-physics, e.g. electrical-hydraulic  
Modelica-UML-SysML  
Modeling and simulation tools  
CAD modeling  
Design optimization and analysis  
Hardware in the loop simulation  
Real-time and embedded system modeling  
Electrical/hydraulics modeling

  
**OpenModelica Annual Workshop:**

Applications of OpenModelica  
Modelica Libraries with OpenModelica  
OpenModelica tool developments  
Solver issues in OpenModelica  
Meta modeling and hardware/software modeling  
Code generation in Openmodelica  
Parallel compilation and execution

  
**Submission**

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit draft presentations, extended abstracts,   
or full paper drafts for consideration by the organizing committee.   
The submission can be new or recently published work.  
Submitted Presentations should be two slides per page in the .pdf file.   
The submission should be a .pdf file of maximum 2 Mbyte size,   
to be sent by email to: <modprod-submit@ida.liu.se> for the MODPROD workshop  
and to <openmodelica-submit@ida.liu.se>  
for the OpenModelica Annual Workshop.

  
**Important Dates**

Submission deadline: October 31, 2010

Acceptance notification: November 15, 2010

  
**Publication**

The final version of the presentation, delivered by the presenter at the workshop,  
will be put on the web. Papers will not be published here.   
The authors are free to publish paper versions of their work elsewhere, in conferences or journals.  
The language of the workshops is English.

  
**Supporting organizations**

The Center for Model-based Product Development (MODPROD) is an inter-disciplinary research center at Linköping University. It revolves around model-based tools and methods for mechanical systems, electronic systems and software, and unified approaches for model-based design. This workshop brings together expertise in these fields to discuss state of the art and the way ahead.

The Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC) is a non-profit organization supporting the  
development of the OpenModelica Open-Source implementation of Modelica and   
related tools, e.g. ModelicaML (UML-Modelica integration), for industrial and academic usage.
