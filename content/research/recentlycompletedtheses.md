<p><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/xjobb/PeterFritzson/2010ModelicaOpenCLParallellization.pdf">Parallel Code Generator for Modelica to Nvidia 2 teraflop 2050 GPU</a><br /><br />The goal of this master thesis project is to develop a new parallel code generator to the new portable C-based standard parallel programming model called OpenCL, to generate code for PELABs new 2-teraflop GPU machine, and to perform measurements.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/xjobb/PeterFritzson/2010Bootstrapping-Tailrecursion%20v1.pdf">Efficient Recursion to Loop Conversion for OMC Compiler Bootstrapping </a><br /><br />The goal of this master thesis project is to significantly improve the compilation of recursive calls in MetaModelica to efficient C, by using the so-called tail-recursion optimization that converts recursion into iteration. This makes the code much faster and consuming much less memory. The optimized compiler should be used to enable the OMC compiler to compile itself, i.e., bootstrapping.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/xjobb/PeterFritzson/2010ModelicaTemplateBasedUnparser.pdf">Template Based XML and Modelica Unparsers in OpenModelica</a><br /><br />The goal of this project is to develop new Modelica and XML unparsers using the OpenModelica text template language Susan, which allows consise and powerful text generation programming. The XML unparser should be according to an XML standard defined in the OPENPROD EU project.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/labs/pelab/xjobb/PeterFritzson/2010-Modelicaparser-and-AST-builder.pdf">Modelica Parser Generator and OpenModelica AST-builder </a><br /><br />The goal of this master thesis project is to create a more efficient parser and AST-builder, with good error han-dling, using the existing LL(1) Modelica+MetaModelica grammar as a starting point/raw material. The develop-ment environment is Eclipse, using the MDT (Modelica Development Tooling) Eclipse plug-in and debugger.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/xjobb/PeterFritzson/2010ModelicaDebugger.pdf">Modelica Simulation Debugger in Eclipse Plugin </a><br /><br />The goal of this master thesis project is to extend the current MetaModelica debugger to support the full Modelica algorithmic language as well as some aspects of the simulation modeling language, and integrate this in the boot-strapped OpenModelica compiler. The work will invovle advanced compiler construction, to generate code including mappings from execution addresses to source code positions.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~mohto/exjobb/Thesis_ActionCode_in_ModelicaML.pdf">Support for the Authoring of Action Code in ModelicaML Models</a><br /><br />The main task of this thesis is to develop and prototype an approach for capturing textual parts (e.g. equations, algorithm statements, etc.) of ModelicaML models in a way that is convenient to typical textual IDEs (e.g. JDK) but does not require refactoring of the textual parts of the model if the names of model elements change.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~mohto/exjobb/Thesis_ModelicaML_round-tripping%20.pdf">Roundtrip Engineering for ModelicaML Models</a><br /><br />The main task of this thesis is to develop a round-trip capability between textual Modelica and graphical ModelicaML models. The focus should be on the import of textual Modelica models into ModelicaML models and the resolution of conflicts in case if elements already exist.

The interface should be evolutive enough to easily hold user-defined extensions (e.g. specific languages options in Mines ParisTech tools) or Modelica language updates.

The most promising methods should be implemented and evaluated on test problems as well on real problems provided by SKF using the in house software BEAST, which is a multi-body simulation program specially designed for bearing simulation and also. Some methods should also be implemented in on the OpenModelica platform.
