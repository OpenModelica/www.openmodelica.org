<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The OpenModelica 1.13.0-dev.beta1 is now released.&nbsp;<br /></span>

Download [Linux][18], [Mac][19], [Windows][20]. Report bugs in [Trac][4].

Highlights:

  * OMSimulator 2.0 – the second release of our efficient FMI Simulation tool including a GUI for FMI Composition, co-simulation and model-exchange simulation, and SSP standard support.
  * Model and library encryption/decryption support. (Only for usage by OSMC member organizations)
  * Improved OpenModelica DAEMode for efficient solution of large Modelica models.
  * Julia scripting API to OpenModelica.
  * Basic Matlab scripting API to OpenModelica.
  * OMSysIdent - parameter estimation module for linear and non-linear parametric dynamic models.
  * Interactive simulation and control of simulations with OPC-UA.
  * PDEModelica1 - experimental support for one-dimensional PDEs in Modelica.
  * Analytic directional derivatives for FMI export and efficient calculation of multiple Jacobian columns – giving much faster simulation for some models
  * Enhanced OMEdit – including fast multi-file search.
  * Improved error messages and stability.
  * A version of the new fast compiler frontend available for testing, can be enabled by a flag Currently (December 10), simulates about 84% of MSL 3.2.2

Note: the replaceable GUI support has been moved to OpenModelica 1.14.0 and will be available in nightly builds.
