<p class="MsoBodyText">
  The OpenModelica 1.9.0 beta4 release has a more complete OMC model compiler. It simulates many more models than the previous 1.8.1 version and 1.9.0 beta1 and beta2 releases. This is the first release that simulates many (58%) of the MSL 3.2.1 Fluid models. Regarding the whole MSL 3.2.1, 233 out of 253 example models now simulate (92%) compared to 118 in the beta2 release Oct 20, and 30% in the 1.9.0 beta1 release. There is also partial support for some other libraries like ThermoSysPro. It also contains a further improved ModelicaML version for the latest Eclipse and Papyrus releases.<span lang="EN-US"> </span>

</h2>

  * This release mainly includes bug fixes and improvements of the OpenModelica Compiler (OMC), including, but not restricted to the following:
  * A more stable and complete OMC model compiler. The 1.9.0 beta3 version simulates many more models than the previous 1.8.1 version and OpenModelica 1.9.0 beta1 and beta2 versions.
  * Much better simulation support for MSL 3.2.1, now 233 out of 253 example models simulate (92%) compared to 118 in the beta2 release Oct 20, and 30% in the 1.9.0 beta1 release.
  * Good support for the MSL 3.2.1 MultiBody library. All example models except one simulate using dynamic state selection, the remaining one simulates with a special flag.
  * Fairly good support for the MSL 3.2.1 Fluid library, now 24 example models simulate (58%), and all flatten.
  * Better simulation support for several other libraries, e.g. more than twenty examples simulate from ThermoSysPro, and all but one model from PlanarMechanics simulate.
  * Improved tearing algorithm for the compiler backend. Tearing is by default used.
  * Much faster matching and dynamic state selection algorithms for the compiler backend.
  * New index reduction algorithm implementation.
  * New default initialization method that symbolically solves the initialization problem much faster and more accurately. This is the first version that in general initialize hybrid models correctly.
  * Better class loading from files. The package.order file is now respected and the file structure is more thoroughly examined.
  * It is now possible to translate the error messages in the omc kernel.
  * Enhanced ModelicaML version with support for value bindings in requirements-driven modeling available for the latest Eclipse and Papyrus versions. GUI specific adaptations. Automated model composition workflows (used for model-based design verification against requirements) are modularized and have improved in terms of performance.
  * FMI for co-simulation with OMC as master, and improved FMI import.
  * Checking (when possible) that variables have been assigned to before they are used in algorithmic code.
  * Full version of Python scripting.
  * 3D graphics visualization using the Modelica3D library.
  * Prototype support for uncertainty computations, special feature enabled by special flag.
  * Parallel algorithmic Modelica support (ParModelica) for efficient portable parallel algorithmic programming based on the OpenCL standard, for CPUs and GPUs.
  * Support for optimisation of semiLinear according to MSL 3.3 chapter 3.7.2.5 semiLinear.
  * NOTE: interactive simulation is not operational in this beta release. It will be put back again in the near future, first available as a nightly build. It is also available in the previous 1.8.0 release.
