### &nbsp;

### This is the 1.4.5 release of OpenModelica.

Here are the most important OpenModelica 1.4.5 improvements:   
- Less memory consumption and better memory management over time.  
- New Qt-based 2D plotting and simple 3D visualization.  
- Modelica 3.0 parsing support.  
- Export of DAE to XML and MATLAB.  
- Support for several platforms Linux, MacOS, Windows (2000, Xp, Vista).  
- Support for record and strings as function arguments.  
- Many bug fixes.  
- Additional free graphic editor SimForge can be used with OpenModelica.  
  
_NOTE:_   
_&nbsp;If you have problems with the new plotting functionality you can use the  
&nbsp;old plotting functionality using plot2(var), plot2({va1,...,var2}) and  
&nbsp;plotParametric2(var1, var2)._

Many thanks to all who contributed to this release!  
  
Cheers,
