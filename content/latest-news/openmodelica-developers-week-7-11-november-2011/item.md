Basically we have a free agenda, we just get together from 09:00- to 18:00+&nbsp;  
or as much as we want and work on improving OpenModelica. See the topics above.

This being said, we will have to schedule some presentations:

  * Thursday 10 November 2011,&nbsp;Christoph Höger will talk about 3D graphics and separate compilation.

&nbsp;

## **Travel and Accommodation**

[Hotels][168] in Linköping.  
[Travel][169] to Linköping.

Notes on the&nbsp;buses:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  * You can search schedules using [a travel robot][170] and enter for example: "Linköping Centralstation" and "Vallfarten (Linköping kn)" to find a bus from the railway station to the university.
  * you **[**will have to buy a bus card and load it before going in the bus**][171]**. you can buy and load the card at the train station or some Pressbyrån stores
  * you will have to **press the stop button** in the bus before the station because&nbsp;if no-one has pressed it the bus will not stop. Usually there is a display&nbsp;near the driver and say: "Stannar" if somebody pressed the stop button,&nbsp;also the name of the next station is announced via sound and display.
  * a journey is 15:- SEK so 30:- SEK roundtrip.
  * [bus website in English][172].
