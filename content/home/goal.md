<p>The main goals of the project are to:</p>
<!--      
<ul class="arrow">
-->
<ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Development and long-term support of an open source industrial-strength Modelica modeling and simulation environment for industrial and academic usage. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Creation of a complete reference implementation of Modelica in an extended version of Modelica itself. Promoting a model-centric approach to give the modeler increased control, including modeling of both hardware- and software components in complex systems. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Improved implementation techniques, e.g. to enhance the performance of compiled Modelica code by generating code for parallel hardware. </span></p>
</li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">Research in areas such as language design, control system design, debugging support, embedded system modeling, new symbolic and numerical algorithms, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We invite researchers and students, or any interested developer to participate in the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participate in the <a href="/forum">OpenModelicaInterest</a> discussion forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help us: get the latest <a href="/developersresources/sourcecode">source code or nightly build</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/issues/new/choose">report bugs!</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To learn about Modelica, read a <a href="/research/booksproceedings#books">book</a> or a <a href="/images/docs/userdocs/modprod2012-tutorial1-Peter-Fritzson-ModelicaTutorial.pdf">tutorial</a> about Modelica</p>
