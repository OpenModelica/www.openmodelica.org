OMC is a Modelica compiler, translating Modelica to C code, with a symbol table containing definitions of classes, functions, and variables. Such definitions can be predefined, user-defined, or obtained from libraries. The compiler also includes a Modelica interpreter for interactive usage and constant expression evaluation. The subsystem also includes facilities for building simulation executables linked with selected numerical ODE or DAE solvers.
