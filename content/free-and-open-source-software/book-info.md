As both a step-by-step tutorial for those new to the field and a practical reference to the Modelica language for professionals, this book will give you the grounding you need to take full advantage of <span class="product">MathModelica</span>.

This comprehensive guide provides:&nbsp;

  * An accessible, comprehensive introduction to modern object-oriented design principles and applications, and to the latest version of the Modelica language
  * Discussion of multi-domain system modeling and design with applications (e.g. mechatronics) that have components from several application areas
  * A comprehensive overview of application model libraries for a number of application domains
  * Explanation of the system's architectural techniques for reusability using components and connectors, thus enabling specification of models integrating components from multiple engineering disciplines

This book teaches modeling and simulation and provides an introduction to the Modelica language for people who are familiar with basic programming concepts. It gives a basic introduction to the concepts of modeling and simulation as well as information about the basics of object-oriented component-based modeling for the novice. A comprehensive overview of modeling and simulation in a number of application areas is also included. In fact, the book has several goals:

  * Being a useful textbook in introductory courses on modeling and simulation
  * Being easily accessible for people who do not previously have a background in modeling, simulation and object orientation
  * Introducing the concepts of physical modeling, object-oriented modeling, and component-based modeling
  * Providing a complete, but not too formal reference for the Modelica language
  * Demonstrating modeling examples from a wide range of application areas
  * Being a reference guide for the most commonly used Modelica libraries

This book contains many examples of models in different application domains, as well as examples which combine several domains. However, it is not primarily intended for the advanced modeler who, for example, needs additional insight into modeling within very specific application domains. Likewise, it is not intended for the person who constructs very complex models in which special skills may be needed.
