title: "Efficient Traceable Model-Based Dynamic Optimization – EDOp"
---
The main goal of this project is to develop a more effective model-based optimization approach by integrating optimization into the model-based development process. Models and optimization algorithms are combined into integrated models.

To reduce execution time, we will develop improved methods to compile such integrated models to efficient code for new multi-core architectures.

Profiling and debugging technology will be developed to highlight sources of performance problems.

The project includes development of optimization methods to address:

  1. Computationally heavy goal functions

  2. Dynamic optimal control of startup and load cycles are common industrial&nbsp; application areas with especially problematic computation times.

Many of the results will be made available in a tool extension in the open source OpenModelica platform&nbsp; including interoperability and communication with other tools using the new FMI interface standard.

## Modelica Mathematical Modeling Language

  * Strongly typed object‐oriented language with a general class concept.
  * Declarative – Equation based.
  * Multi domain.
  * Visual Hierarchical Component Programming.
  * Acausal modeling.

## Simulation: Symbolic + Numeric Methods

Compilation of a Modelica model will result in a system of sorted equations. Simulation is the runtime solution of such an equation system using a solver scheme and a run‐time system.
