</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">The OSMC-PL is a public license for OpenModelica with three modes/alternatives (GPL, OSMC-Internal-EPL, OSMC-External-EPL) for use and redistribution, in source and/or binary/object-code form:</span>
</p>

  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">GPL. Any party (member or non-member of OSMC) may use and redistribute OpenModelica under GPL version 3.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Level 1 members of OSMC may also use and redistribute OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL conditions.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Level 2 members of OSMC may also use and redistribute OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL or OSMC-External-EPL conditions.</span>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Definitions of OSMC Public licence modes:</span>
</p>

  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">GPL = GPL version 3. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">OSMC-Internal-EPL = These OSMC Public license conditions together with Internally restricted EPL, i.e., EPL version 1.0 with the <em>Additional Condition</em> that use and redistribution by an OSMC member is only allowed within the OSMC member's own organization (i.e., its own legal entity).</span>
  * <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">OSMC-External-EPL = These OSMC Public license conditions together with Externally restricted EPL, i.e., EPL version 1.0 with the <em>Additional Condition</em> that use and redistribution by an OSMC member to parties external to the OSMC member’s own organization (i.e., its own legal entity), is only allowed in binary/object-code form, except the case of redistribution to other OSMC members to which source is also allowed to be distributed. </span>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">[<em>This has the consequence that an external party who wishes to use OpenModelica in source form together with its own proprietary software in all cases must be a member of OSMC</em>].</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">In all cases of usage and redistribution by recipients, the following conditions also apply:</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">a) Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, all definitions, and conditions. It is sufficient if the OSMC-PL Header is present in each source file, if the full OSMC-PL is available in a prominent and easily located place in the redistribution.</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">b) Redistributions in binary/object-code form must reproduce the above copyright notice, all definitions, and conditions. It is sufficient if the OSMC-PL Header and the location in the redistribution of the full OSMC-PL is present in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the redistribution, if the full OSMC-PL is available in a prominent and easily located place in the redistribution.</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">c) A recipient must clearly indicate its chosen usage mode of OSMC-PL, in accompanying documentation and in a text file OSMC-USAGE-MODE.txt, provided with the distribution.</span>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">d) Contributor(s) making a Contribution to OpenModelica thereby also makes a Transfer of Contribution Copyright. In return, upon the effective date of the transfer, OSMC grants the Contributor(s) a Contribution License of the Contribution. OSMC has the right to accept or refuse Contributions.</span>
